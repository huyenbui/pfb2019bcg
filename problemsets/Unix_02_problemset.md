# Unix 2 Problem Set

1. Create a directory call `files` in your ProblemSets directory. 

2. Move the file you renamed from `sequences.nt.fa` to `cancer_genes.fasta` to your `files` directory

3. Using your text editor (nano is a good one to start with) create a fasta file and name it `mysequences.txt`. Make sure it ends up in your problem sets files directory.

This is fasta file format:
```
>seqName description
ATGGCGTCTTGGCCTTAAAAGCTC
```

4. Create a directory called `fastas`.     (Hint: use mkdir)
5. Copy the fasta file that you renamed to `cancer_genes.fasta` to the fasta directory.
6. Verify that the file is within the fasta directory.  
7. Delete the the original file that you used for copying.  
8. Read the man page for `rm` and `cp` to find out how to remove and copy a directory.
9. Print out your history and redirect it to a file called `unixBasics.history.txt`
10. Open this file with your text editor and delete any lines you do not want to keep.
